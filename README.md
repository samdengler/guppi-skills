# guppi-skills

Personal collection of CLI tools that double as AI agent skills. Each skill is a standalone Python CLI paired with a SKILL.md manifest for agent discovery.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for conventions and how to create new skills.

## Installation

Install any skill directly from the repo:

```bash
cd <skill-name>/
uv tool install .
```

## Skills
